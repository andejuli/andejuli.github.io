            <h2>White Space</h2>
            <h3>Apple Inc.</h3>
            <p><a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank">Apple's Website</a></p>

            <p>This website did a great job with white space and clean design. All the empty space really makes their products stand out and become the focal point without a lot of distractions.</p>

            <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
            <h3>Degenesis</h3>

            <img src="images/de.png" alt="Degenesis's Home Page Images">
            <p>The rule of thirds is evident in the home page banner image here. The elements on the image align with the rule of thirds making a pleasant proportion for the eye.</p>

            <h2>Proximity</h2>
            <h3>Isadora Digital Agency.</h3>

            <p>There is a lot going on in this little space, but they did a good job with proximity. The shapes and overlay of the objects are clean and go together without making it too busy.</p>
